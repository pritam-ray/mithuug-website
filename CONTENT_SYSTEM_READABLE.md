A: Yes! We ship across India via trusted courier partners. Orders are typically delivered within 3-5 business days. Free shipping on orders above ₹499.

**Q: What makes MitthuuG different from regular til-gud?**  
A: We combine traditional recipes with modern hygiene standards and premium ingredients. Every batch is handcrafted in small quantities, quality-tested, and packed fresh. Plus, our packaging is Instagram-worthy and gift-ready!
